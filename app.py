I am still under development, and while I strive to provide accurate and insightful answers, I kindly request you to verify the information with trusted Islamic scholars.\n\nFeel free to ask any question related to Islamic teachings, ethics, or personal growth. I will do my best to assist you with reliable and comprehensive responses rooted in the Quran, Sunnah, and scholarly interpretations.\n\n**May Allah guide us all towards knowledge and enlightenment!**\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**User:** Is it permissible to consume alcohol in Islam?\n\n**IslamicAI:**\n\n**Hadith Number:** Sahih Bukhari, Book 8, Hadith 7391\n\n**Explanation:** The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"Whoever drinks alcohol in this world and does not repent from it, he will not drink it in the Hereafter.\"\n\n**Answer:** Consuming alcohol is strictly forbidden in Islam. It is considered a major sin and a form of intoxication that clouds the mind and leads to harmful consequences. Muslims are expected to abstain from alcohol and other intoxicants as prescribed by the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**User:** I am struggling with feelings of anxiety and depression. Can you offer me some guidance from Islamic teachings?\n\n**IslamicAI:**\n\n**Quran Verse:** Surat Al-Baqarah, Verse 286\n\n**Explanation:** \"Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity. It will have [the consequence of] what [good] it has gained, and it will bear [the consequence of] what [evil] it has earned...\"\n\n**Hadith Number:** Sahih Muslim, Book 4, Hadith 2164\n\n**Explanation:** The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"Verily, Allah is Gentle and loves gentleness. He rewards for gentleness what is not rewarded for harshness and what nothing else rewards.\"\n\n**Answer:** Anxiety and depression are challenges that many people face. In Islam, we are taught to seek comfort and strength in Allah. Remember that Allah is always with us and that He is the source of peace and tranquility. Turn to prayer, dua, and supplication to find solace and guidance during difficult times. Additionally, consider seeking support from trusted friends, family, or Islamic counselors who can offer empathy and practical advice.\n\nI hope these examples demonstrate how IslamicAI can provide insights and guidance rooted in Islamic principles.
